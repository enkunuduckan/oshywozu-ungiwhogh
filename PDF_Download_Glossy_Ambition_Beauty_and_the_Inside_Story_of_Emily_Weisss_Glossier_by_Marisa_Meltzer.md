INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ‚Ä¢ Financial Times Best Book of the Year
 
 The ‚Äúcompulsively readable narrative of beauty, business, privilege, and mogul-dom‚Äù (The New York Times) that reveals‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîexactly wat happened at Glossier, one of America‚Äôs hottest and most consequential startups, and dives deep into the enigmatic, visionary woman responsible for it all.
 
 Called ‚Äúone of the most disruptive brands in beauty‚Äù by Forbes, Glossier revolutionized the beauty industry with its sophisticated branding and unique approach to influencer marketing, almost instantly making the company a juggernaut with rabid fans. It also taught a generation of business leaders how to talk to Millennial and Gen Z customers and build a cult following online.
 
 At the center of the story lies Emily Weiss, the elusive former Teen Vogue ‚Äúsuperintern‚Äù on the reality show The Hills turned Into the Gloss beauty blogger who had the vision, guts, and searing ambition needed to launch Glossier. She cannily turned every experience, every meeting into an opportunity to fuel her own personal success. Together with her expensive, signature style and singular vision for the future of consumerism, she could not be stopped. Just how did a girl from suburban Connecticut with no real job experience work her way into the bathrooms and boudoirs of the most influential names in the world and build that access into a 1.9-billion-dollar business? Is she solely responsible for its success? And why, eight years later, at the height of Glossier mania, did she step down?
 
 In Glossy, journalist and author Marisa Meltzer combines in-depth interviews with former Glossier employees, investors, and Weiss herself to bring you inside the walls of this fascinating and secretive company. From fundraising to product launches and unconventional hiring practices, Meltzer exposes the inner workings of Glossier‚Äôs culture, culminating in the story of Weiss herself. The Devil Wears Prada for the Bad Blood generation, Glossy is not just a gripping portrait of one of the most important business leaders of her generation, but also a chronicle of an era.
