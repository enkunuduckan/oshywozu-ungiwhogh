Overview
&quot;Coates ratchets up the ghostly manifestations till you can&#039;t imagine there are any more stops to pull outâ€”though of course there are.&quot; â€”Kirkus Reviews for Gallows Hill When Jenine finds an abandoned polaroid camera, she playfully snaps a photo without a second thought. But there&#039;s something wrong with the image: a ghostly figure stands in the background, watching her. Fixated on her. Moving one step closer with every picture she takes. Desperate, Jenine shares her secret with her best friend, Bree. Together they realize the camera captures unsettling impressions of the dead. But now the ghosts seem to be following the two friends. And with each new photo taken, a terrible danger grows ever clearerâ€¦ INCLUDES CHILLING NEW BONUS STORIES: A woman survives a plane crash in a remote arctic tundra, accompanied only by a stranger who seems fixated on something moving through the blinding snow. A house stands empty. Hungry. Waiting for the children drawn to it like moths to a flame. A woman finds a shoebox filled with old VHS tapes. They have a note attached: &quot;Don&#039;t watch. You&#039;ll regret it.&quot; And more!
