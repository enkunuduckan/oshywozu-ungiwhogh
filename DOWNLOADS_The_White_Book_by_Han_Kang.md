Shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker International Prize

 From Booker Prize-winner and literary phenomenon Han Kang, a lyrical and disquieting exploration of personal grief, written through the prism of the color white

 While on a writer&amp;#039;s residency, a nameless narrator wanders the twin white worlds of the blank page and snowy Warsaw. THE WHITE BOOK becomes a meditation on the color white, as well as a fictional journey inspired by an older sister who died in her mother&amp;#039;s arms, a few hours old. The narrator grapples with the tragedy that has haunted her family, an event she colors in stark white--breast milk, swaddling bands, the baby&amp;#039;s rice cake-colored skin--and, from here, visits all that glows in her memory: from a white dog to sugar cubes.

 As the writer reckons with the enormity of her sister&amp;#039;s death, Han Kang&amp;#039;s trademark frank and chilling prose is softened by retrospection, introspection, and a deep sense of resilience and love. THE WHITE BOOK--ultimately a letter from Kang to her sister--offers powerful philosophy and personal psychology on the tenacity and fragility of the human spirit, and our attempts to graft new life from the ashes of destruction.
