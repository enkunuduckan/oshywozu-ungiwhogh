Overview
Brigid Kemmerer continues her bestselling fantasy series in another tale full of dark magic, new love, and a kingdom on the edge of ruin. Find the heir, win the crown. The curse is finally broken, but Prince Rhen of Emberfall faces darker troubles still. Rumors circulate that he is not the true heir and that forbidden magic has been unleashed. Although Rhen has Harper by his side, his guardsman Grey is missing, leaving more questions than answers. Win the crown, save the kingdom. Rumored to be the heir, Grey has been on the run since he destroyed Lilith. He has no desire to challenge Rhenâ€”until Karis Luran once again threatens to take Emberfall by force. Her own daughter Lia Mara sees the flaws in her motherâ€™s violent plan, but can she convince Grey to stand against Rhen, even for the good of Emberfall? The compulsively readable saga continues as loyalties are tested and new love blooms in a kingdom on the brink of war.
